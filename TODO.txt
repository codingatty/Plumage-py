For preliminary Python2 to Python3 alignment:

_X_ StringIO import
_X_ urllib2 / urllib import
_X_ print as function
_X_ except..as  syntax

Other features
_X_ default pause between TSDR calls
_X_ Provide metainfo via GetMetainfo
_X_ Make metainfo consistent (keys & values) between GetMetainfo() and runtime TSDRData
_X_ Support for MetaInfoExecTSDRStartTimestamp and MetaInfoExecTSDRCompleteTimestamp
_X_ Switch from ugly "unset..." in some cases to uniform "reset..." 
___ Fix timing tests
_X_ Make ST.96 XML default, not ZIP (60 queries/min, rather than 4)
_X_ Add API key suppport
_X_ Remove Python 2 specific material (eventually)
___ Note Python 3.6 required (timespec argument in isoformat() calls)
_X_ PEP 476: remove complicating code to support pre-PEP versions of Python
    (PEP 476 was implemented in Python 3.4.3, and Plumage-py reqs at least Python 3.6)
