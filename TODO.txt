For preliminary Python2 to Python3 alignment:

_X_ StringIO import
_X_ urllib2 / urllib import
_X_ print as function
_X_ except..as  syntax

Other features
_X_ default pause between TSDR calls
_X_ Provide metainfo via GetMetainfo
_X_ Make metainfo consistent (keys & values) between GetMetainfo() and runtime TSDRData
