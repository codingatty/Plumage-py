Other features
_X_ default pause between TSDR calls
_X_ Provide metainfo via GetMetainfo

Likely future stuff (wish-list):
___ support for disclaimers (see reg. 5561934 for example with multiple disclaimers)
___ allow options on TSDRReq() instantiation (e.g., t = plumage.TSDRReq(APIKey="xxxxx"))
___ allow option-setting via dictionary (e.g., t = plumage.TSDRReq(options=optionsdict))
___ add unit test for 429 (separate to keep from hammering TSDR server and logging ecxessive requests)
___ add unit-test checking for zip-specific stuff (image, for example)
___ coordinate time-delay setting with setPTOFormat() (15-20 for zip; 1-1.5 for XML)
___ time-sensitive default time settings 
     regular limits: Zip: 4/minute; XML: 60/minute
     off-peak limits: zip: 12/minute; XML: 120/minute
